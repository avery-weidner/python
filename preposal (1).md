# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I think it would be cool to build a website of some sorts. In this website, I could have a quiz for the user to take that would ask questions that will in the end give them a result as to how similar they are to me as a percentage using an alorithm I would make. I'm open to criticism if this doesnt sound like a good project. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Would I be able to do this all in python? I'm not entirely sure if when building a website you can just put the code in python into the website. Clearly I need to do a good deal of research on my own about this. I'll take any feedback on my idea or any suggestions on where to start!
